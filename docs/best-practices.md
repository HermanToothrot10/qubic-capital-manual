## Best Practices for QCAP Holders

Qubic Capital governance relies on active participation from QCAP holders.

To contribute effectively:
- **Lock QCAP** early to avoid missing voting rights in critical epochs
- **Monitor proposals regularly**, as they can be created at any time
- **Vote consistently**, even on proposals you consider routine
- **Read GitHub links carefully** before voting
- **Engage in discussions** on Discord to shape proposals before they reach a vote
- **Think long-term**, prioritizing decisions that strengthen the treasury and sustainability of Qubic Capital

Governance is permissionless, but its quality depends on informed and engaged participants.

Influence is earned through commitment, attention, and participation.
