## Best Practices

Qubic Capital governance relies on active participation from QCAP holders.

To contribute effectively:
- **Lock QCAP** early to avoid missing voting rights in critical epochs
- **Monitor proposals regularly**, as they can be created at any time
- **Vote consistently**, even on proposals you consider routine
- **Read GitHub links carefully** before voting
- **Engage in discussions** on Discord to shape proposals before they reach a vote
- **Think long-term**, prioritizing decisions that strengthen the treasury and sustainability of Qubic Capital
