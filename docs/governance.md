Qubic Capital operates as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) through QVAULT v2.

Decisions are made through proposals that are voted on by QCAP holders with voting power. Depending on the proposal type, execution may be automatic (on-chain) or operational (off-chain).

All proposals:

- Must include a **GitHub link** explaining the rationale and details
- Require a **10,000,000 Qubic proposal fee**
- Finish automatically at **epoch change (Wednesday 12:00 UTC)**

The proposal fee is transferred to the QVAULT treasury to prevent spam and strengthen DAO reserves.
