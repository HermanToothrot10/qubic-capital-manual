# GP — General Proposal

## Purpose

Used for topics that **do not clearly fit into other proposal categories**. Typically applied to governance, coordination, or strategic matters.

Examples include:

- Appointment of representatives
- Selection of moderators
- Strategic or organizational decisions

## Required inputs

- GitHub link describing the proposal

## Voting & approval

- Quorum must be reached
- Yes votes must exceed No votes

## Execution outcome

Execution is not automatic. If approved, **the proposal is executed off-chain**, outside the smart contract, by the Qubic Capital admins, according to the approved decision.

Multiple approved proposals of this type may coexist and be effective at the same time.
