## Voting Power

Only wallets with voting power can vote on proposals.

To obtain voting power:
1. **Transfer QCAP management rights** to QVAULT
2. **Lock QCAP** in the QVAULT smart contract
3. **Wait one epoch** (voting power becomes active in the next epoch)

Voting rights cannot be used in the same epoch in which QCAP is locked.
Locking QCAP in QVAULT is the only way to participate in governance.
