# Qubic Capital – User Manual

**Website Usage & QVAULT v2 Governance**

This manual provides a clear and structured guide to using Qubic Capital through QVAULT v2. It explains governance mechanics, proposal types, voting logic, execution rules, fund allocation priority, and the main features available on the platform.

## Governance Overview

Qubic Capital operates as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) through QVAULT v2.

Decisions are made through proposals that are voted on by QCAP holders with voting power. Depending on the proposal type, execution may be automatic (on-chain) or operational (off-chain).

All proposals:

Must include a **GitHub link** explaining the rationale and details

Require a **10,000,000 Qubic proposal fee**

Finish automatically at **epoch change (Wednesday 12:00 UTC)**

The proposal fee is transferred to the QVAULT treasury to prevent spam and strengthen DAO reserves.
