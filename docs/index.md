# Qubic Capital – User Manual

**Website Usage & QVAULT v2 Governance**

This manual provides a clear and structured guide to using Qubic Capital through QVAULT v2. It explains governance mechanics, proposal types, voting logic, execution rules, fund allocation priority, and the main features available on the platform.

## Governance Overview

Qubic Capital operates as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) through QVAULT v2.

Decisions are made through proposals that are voted on by QCAP holders with voting power. Depending on the proposal type, execution may be automatic (on-chain) or operational (off-chain).

All proposals:

Must include a **GitHub link** explaining the rationale and details

Require a **10,000,000 Qubic proposal fee**

Finish automatically at **epoch change (Wednesday 12:00 UTC)**

The proposal fee is transferred to the QVAULT treasury to prevent spam and strengthen DAO reserves.

## Voting Power

Only wallets with voting power can vote on proposals.

To obtain voting power:
1. **Transfer QCAP management rights** to QVAULT
2. **Lock QCAP** in the QVAULT smart contract
3. **Wait one epoch** (voting power becomes active in the next epoch)

Voting rights cannot be used in the same epoch in which QCAP is locked.
Locking QCAP in QVAULT is the only way to participate in governance.
