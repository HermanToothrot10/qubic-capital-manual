## Website Functionalities

In addition to governance, the QVAULT website provides several core actions:
- **Buy QCAP** from an active fundraising round (primary market)
- **Transfer asset management rights** for QCAP or any other asset to and from QVAULT
- **Lock QCAP** to obtain voting power
- **Submit proposals** (if eligible)

These actions are required to fully participate in governance and asset operations.
